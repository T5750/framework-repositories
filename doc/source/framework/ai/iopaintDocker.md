# IOPaint Docker

IOPaint is a free, open-source and fully self-hostable inpainting/outpainting tool powered by state-of-the-art AI models.
- **Erase**: Remove any unwanted object, defect, watermarks, people.
- **Inpainting**: Make modifications to specific parts of the image, add new objects, or replace anything on your pictures.
- **Outpainting**: Generate new pixels around your images to make it larger.

## Start webui
```sh
# In order to use GPU, install cuda version of pytorch first.
# pip3 install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# AMD GPU users, please utilize the following command, only works on linux, as pytorch is not yet supported on Windows with ROCm.
# pip3 install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.6
pip3 install iopaint
iopaint start --model=lama --device=cpu --port=8080
```

```

## Docker

## Tips
### Delete downloaded models:
By default IOPaint download model to `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/` / `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` For Windows users, it's `C:\Users\your_name\.cache\torch\hub\checkpoints\` or `C:\Users\your_name\.cache\huggingface\hub`.

>âš The default model cache directory may contain other models, so you should only delete the IOPaint related models.

## Runtime Environment
- [Python 3.9.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
